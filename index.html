      <h1> Balboa Park </h1>    
      <p class="green"> I visited Balboa park also dubbed as "the cultural heart of San Diego". Balboa park is located less than 20 minutes from
          downtown. Balboa park hosts the San Diego zoo, 18 museums as well as beautiful gardens.  </p>

     <h1> La Jolla Shores</h1>
     <p class="green"> After our visit to Balboa park, we ate a local Mexican restaurant and then rested. The following day we visited La Jolla Shores. You have not
         visited San Diego if you have not stepped foot on any of the beautiful San Diego beaches. La Jolla Shores is a sandy beach approximately 1 mile long
         located in La Jolla, California. The sunset was breathtaking coupled with the sound of the waves and the breeze from the ocean.
          It was a very relaxing moment for my family. </p>

            <h1> Sea World</h1>
            <p class="green"> We ended our San Diego vacation by visiting Sea World. Sea World San Diego is an animal theme park, oceanarium, outside aquarium, and marine mammal park, in San Diego, California, United States, inside Mission Bay Park.
                 My son especially enjoyed his time watching killer whales. </p>
